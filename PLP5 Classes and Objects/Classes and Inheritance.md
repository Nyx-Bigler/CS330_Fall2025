Does your language support objects or something similar (e.g., structs or records)?
- Yes! classes and Objects and structs and other stuff

Are there naming conventions for objects, instance variables, 
or functions that people writing in your language should be aware of?
- classes CAPITAL FIRST LETTER

Does your language have standard methods for functions that serve a similar purpose across all objects? 
For example, toString() in Java and __str__ in Python allow information about the objects to be printed. 
Are there similar functions in your language?
- Don't think so

How does inheritance work (if it does)? Does your language support multiple inheritance?
- yes, both multi level, and multiple inheritance

If there is inheritance, how does your language deal with overloading method names and resolving those calls?
- "closest call" whichever is in within that class, or it'll thow an error?

Is there anything else that’s important to know about objects and inheritance in your language?
- *melting smily face*

(I know this question is vague, but objects are were languages can vary a lot, 
so it’s hard to ask questions that will apply to everyone.)
