Does your language support objects or something similar (e.g., structs or records)?

Are there naming conventions for objects, instance variables, 
or functions that people writing in your language should be aware of?

Does your language have standard methods for functions that serve a similar purpose across all objects? 
For example, toString() in Java and __str__ in Python allow information about the objects to be printed. 
Are there similar functions in your language?

How does inheritance work (if it does)? Does your language support multiple inheritance?

If there is inheritance, how does your language deal with overloading method names and resolving those calls?

Is there anything else that’s important to know about objects and inheritance in your language?

I know this question is vague, but objects are were languages can vary a lot, 
so it’s hard to ask questions that will apply to everyone.
