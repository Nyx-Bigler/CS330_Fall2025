(NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED)

In the meanwhile while I transition over to C++, here are the download instructions I used.
I am using VSCode on a windows machine, so first I had to get a working C compiler onto my computer. (I used mingw)
If you are on a unix or Linux machine you will likely have a much easier time with this, 
and of course need to follow different instructions as a result.

Anyway, here is the tutorial I followed, I wish you luck!

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
C# (c sharp) is a C based, object oriented programming language that's part of the microsoft .NET framework.
It can do quite a lot, and it's most popular applications is for making well... applications.
It's also used in gaming, web service features, cross platform interactions (Windows, IOS, Android, and Linux), 
and anything else that relies on a highly interactive GUI. 
C# also being part of the microsoft .NET framework means it also carries with it all of that functionality.

But of course, it didn't start out that way.
C# development began by Anders Hejlsberg and Mads Torgersen in 1999. 
Origionally intented to be called COOL: C-like Object Oriented Language, but they went with C# instead upon release in 2000.
It came out not long after java, (Java being a mid 90's language) which made it's early years a bit awkward.
At first the two languages were quite similar, (both being C based) and people called C# a "java clone" but the two quickly developed in divergent ways.
Especially after the C#2.0 update in 2005 C# very much stood on it's own, not just in the shadow of Java or C++.

C# really came into the limelight with it's cross platform capabilities and projects.
In 2004 the open source Mono project made C# not just viable for microsoft, but also for Linux and other OS.
This (at least I think) is a big part of what set C# appart from it's neighbors, and why it's so effective for writing applications today!
It's object oriented, familiar to anyone who's written in C based languages, cross platform compatible, and very efficient.
Altogether, a very worthwhile language to learn.
