(NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED)

In the meanwhile while I transition over to C++, here are the download instructions I used.
I am using VSCode on a windows machine, so first I had to get a working C compiler onto my computer. (I used mingw)
If you are on a unix or Linux machine you will likely have a much easier time with this, 
and of course need to follow different instructions as a result.

Anyway, here is the tutorial I followed, I wish you luck!
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

for learning resources, I will be using W3Schools and likely a misc collection of youtube videos.
