# C++ an Abbreviated History...

C++ (Created by Bjarne Stroustrup, and first implimented in 1979) was origionally known as "C with classes", but it was then changed to C++ in 1983. Initially it was joking shorthand of just "incrimented C" (because ++ is shorthand for incrimenting a variable) but like many other coding in-jokes *(feel free to look up how UNIX got it's name)* it wasn't long before it became official.

Since it's creation it has remained quite firmly in the public eye. It's first book being published in 1985, then updated again in 1989. The language and it's asscociated literature have recieved periodic updates over the years, the largest of them being 1998 (the first international standard), 2011 (probably the largest update), and 2020 (more libraries, and complex comparison operations). It is both an old and new language I think, C has been around for a very long time and it has all the robust-ness and speed of C, while also bringing in the complexity and nuance of other modern languages. It's a fun language to learn, and there's lots you can do with it!

Okay, but now that we've gone over the background, let's talk download.
I am using VSCode on a windows machine, so first I had to get a working C compiler onto my computer. (I used mingw)
If you are on a unix or Linux machine you will likely have a much easier time with this, 
and of course need to follow different instructions as a result.

Here is the tutorial I followed for my machine, I wish you luck!

for learning resources, I will be using W3Schools and likely a misc collection of youtube videos.
