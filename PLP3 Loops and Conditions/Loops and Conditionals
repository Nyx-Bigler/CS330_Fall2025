What are the boolean values in your language? (e.g., True and False, true and false, 1, and 0, etc.)

What types of conditional statements are available in your language?  (if/else, if/then/else, if/elseif/else).

Does your language allow for statements other than “if” 
(for example, Perl has an “unless” statement, which does the opposite of “if”!)

How does your language delimit code blocks under each condition in selection control statements?

Does your language use short-circuit evaluation?  Include an example of the short-circuit logic working or not working 
(or both, if your language is like Java and supports both!)

How does your programming language deal with the “dangling else” problem?

If your language supports switch or case statements, do you have to use “break” to get out of them?  
Can you use “continue” to have all of the conditions evaluated?
